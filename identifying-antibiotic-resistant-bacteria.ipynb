It is also effective in typhoid fever and some sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea.\n\n<b>Ciprofloxacin</b>\n\n> Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic, used in the treatment of bacterial infections. It is also used in treating infections of the urinary tract, nose, throat, skin and soft tissues and lungs (pneumonia). It prevents the bacterial cells from dividing and repairing, thereby killing them.\n\n<b>Cefixime</b>\n\n> Cefixime is an antibiotic medicine used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is effective in infections of the respiratory tract (eg. pneumonia), urinary tract, ear, nasal sinus, throat, and some sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n### **<span style='color:#E888BB'>UNITIGS</span>**\n\nIn our dataset, we will come across features data that will convey the presence or absence of a particular <b>nucleotide</b> sequence in the <b>Bacteria's DNA</b>\n\nFrom <b>ML Workshop Starter</b> | [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/nwheeler443/ml-workshop-starter-notebook)\n\n> For this analysis, we're using <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>unitigs</span></b>, stretches of DNA (in string format) shared by a subset of the strains in our study. <br>\n> Unitigs are an efficient but flexible way of representing DNA variation in bacteria. <br>\n> If you'd like to learn more about unitigs, and how this dataset was constructed, have a look at this [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007758). <br>\n> The full dataset consists of 584,362 unitigs, which takes a long time to train models on, so for this exercise <br>\n> we will be using a set that has been filtered for unitigs associated with resistance.\n\n- We will look through these <b>unitigs</b> in the <b>EDA</b> section, which are located in <b>.Ttab</b> files based on available & past treatment data.\n\n<div style=\"color:white;\n       display:fill;\n       border-radius:5px;\n       background-color:#323232;\n       font-size:220%;\n       font-family:Nexa;\n       letter-spacing:0.5px\">\n    <p style=\"padding: 10px;\n          color:white;\">\n        <b>1.2 | TARGET VARIABLES</b>\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n<b><span style='color:#E888BB'>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span></b> is either resistant (<code>target=1</code>) to a particular treatment or not resistant (<code>target=0</code>) for a particular.\n\n### **<span style='color:#E888BB'>AVAILABLE UNITIG DATA</span>**\n\nWe will be choosing one of the following <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>antibiotic</span></b> cases below:\n\n> - Bacteria resistance to <code>Azithromycin</code>; <code>azm_sr</code>\n> - Bacteria resistance to <code>Ciprofloxacin</code>; <code>cip_sr</code>\n> - Bacteria resistance to <code>Cefixime</code>; <code>cfx_sr</code>\n\n### **<span style='color:#E888BB'>UNAVAILABLE UNITIG DATA</span>**\n\nWe don't currently have <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>unitig</span></b> data for the following antibiotics, so we can't check these cases:\n\n> - Bacteria resistance to <code>Ceftriaxone</code>;
